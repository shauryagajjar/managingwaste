    essay: `Did you know that a simple scrap of paper can turn into a massive global waste? Paper waste is a type of waste that can be reduced, reused, and recycled easily. But the downside is that not many are giving it importance. In this essay, not only will I discuss how paper waste is a serious problem because it affects the environment and harms humans, but also provide solutions to manage paper waste.

One major effect of paper waste is on the environment. Paper waste has increased greatly, making it difficult for the environment to handle. First of all, paper comes from wood, so deforestation in order to produce more paper. This reduces habitats, leading to loss of biodiversity. Secondly, paper manufacturing can make water unsafe for drinking and bathing, killing aquatic plants and animals. It also disturbs the natural balance of ecosystems. Finally, paper factories contribute to overall environmental degradation and increase dirty surroundings, which attracts pests and insects. This shows that paper waste is harmful to the environment.

Another big impact of paper waste is on humans. Firstly, paper factories produce chemicals like chlorine and sulfur dioxide, which can lead to breathing problems like asthma and allergies. It can also affect the health of people living around the factories by contaminating nearby water bodies and air. Moreover, when paper is thrown into landfills, it mixes with other waste and occupies a lot of space. If it's decomposed without air, it releases a harmful gas called methane. Additionally, school offices and industries spend a lot on paper every day. If paper is reused and recycled, we can save money, and it won't end up in landfills. This shows that the paper waste doesn't only affect the environment, but humans too.

There are many solutions that can help reduce paper waste. To begin with, we can prioritize the 3 R's - Reduce, Reuse, and recycle. By following the 3 RS- reduce, reuse, and recycle. By following the 3 R's, we can save trees as well as energy. Furthermore, we can buy products made from eco-friendly materials and support companies that follow sustainable practices. Lastly, to balance the loss of trees used for paper, participate in tree planting activities and protect existing trees in your surroundings. If people follow these steps, we will be able to save our money by reducing, reusing, and recycling paper waste as we save the environment. As you can see, paper waste may not look like a major problem, but it can harm the environment.

As we can see, paper waste may not seem like a major problem, but it can harm the environment and humans if it is not managed properly. In conclusion, this essay explains how paper waste affects our surroundings, impacts human health, and the solutions that can be taken to address it. Ultimately, everyone can contribute by following the 3Rs and composting paper waste. By working together, we can make our community cleaner, greener and healthier for all.`,

    essay: `Do you know that the plastic which you throw remains in the environment for about soo years? Plastic waste includes all the plastic material that is discovered, such as bags, bottles, and household items. Most of this waste is single-use plastic, which is discarded. In this essay, not only will I discuss how plastic waste is a serious problem because it affects the environment and harms humans, but I will also explain the possible solutions to manage plastic waste.

One major effect of plastic is on the environment. Firstly, plastic takes hundreds of years to decompose. When plastic bags get mixed with soil, they block the movement of nutrients and water, which obstructs plant growth. In addition, marine animals swallow plastic pieces, which can injure or even kill them. Lastly, burning plastic releases toxic gases that pollute the air and cause air pollution and health problems, such as breathing issues. It also leads to climate change, resulting in global warming. This shows that plastic waste is harmful to the environment.

Another big impact of plastic waste is on humans. Begin with microplastics entering the air, drinking water, and food. Breathing or consuming them may cause digestive problems, hormonal imbalance, and breathing issues. Further, plastic contains chemicals that can leak into food and water. These chemicals may cause allergies, weaken immunity, and damage internal organs. Moreover, burning plastic releases poisonous gases like carbon monoxide. These gases cause respiratory problems, increase the risk of heart disease, cancer, lung problems, and eye irritation. This shows that plastic waste is dangerous to human health.

There are many solutions that can help reduce plastic waste. Initially, say no to single-use plastic and use reusable bags. Also, people should use metal or glass bottles instead of plastic bottles. Furthermore, reuse containers, jars, and boxes for storage; new containers can be made from eco-friendly materials. Plastic waste should be kept separate from wet waste at home. Finally, encourage others to follow responsible waste management techniques, and the government can also conduct awareness programs to encourage citizens to follow sustainable and recyclable packaging. If people follow these steps, we can reduce the harmful effects of plastic waste.

In summary, plastic can have a serious impact on humans and the environment; therefore, prepared solutions should be taken. In concussion this essay explained how plastic waste harms us, hurts the environment, and what solutions can be taken to manage it. Overall, if we do not follow these rules, plastic becomes not only a harmful waste that hazardous waste.`,

    essay: `Did you know that the food which is produced through agriculture and is raised like a God can impact human life if the agriculture is not managed properly? Agricultural waste includes all the unwanted or leftover food produced from farming activities. In this essay, I will discuss how agricultural waste is a serious problem because it affects human life and harms the environment. I will also explain the possible solutions to manage agricultural waste.

One major effect of agricultural waste is on the environment. Firstly, pesticides contain harmful chemicals that can mix with crops and soil,making them unsafe. They can take contaminated food and waste. Secondly, when farmers burn the agricultural waste. It releases smoke and poisonous gases into the air. This leads to air pollution and causes breathing problems. Moreover, untreated waste that is thrown into nearby waste affects aquatic life, contaminates it, and this shows that agricultural waste is harmful to the environment.

Another big impact of agricultural waste is on humans, to benign many people suffer from skin problems due to unsafe water. Moving further, people also face breathing issues, asthma attacks, and many more serious problems. Furthermore, contamination of water causes the death of humans and also releases toxic gases, such as CO2. This shows that agricultural waste is dangerous for humans.

There are many solutions that can help in managing agricultural waste. For enough, crop residue, vegetables & animal manure can be converted into organic compost. This enriched soil reduces the need for chemical fertilizers. In fact, animal waste can be used to produce biogas gas a clean fuel. The leftover slurry becomes fertilizer. Moreover, treatment of farm wastewater before letting it flow into water bodies can also help in managing the agricultural waste. We can use drip irrigation to reduce the loss of water. If people follow these steps, then the whole world will improve. Government & communities should also spread awareness about proper waste management methods.

All in all, if you treat this waste properly, it will help in the reduction of contamination of water and food. This essay explained how agricultural waste harms humans, hurts the environment, and what solutions can change history. So remember, behind every plate there is tons of waste, so take as much as you can consume.`,

    essay: `Did you know that your negligence of biomedical waste can result in various human diseases and other environmental impacts? This waste is often generated from hospitals, clinics, households, and pharmacies. There are four types of biomedical waste: hazardous, infectious, general, and radioactive. In this essay, not only will I discuss how biomedical waste affects the environment and humans, but also discuss the possible solutions to manage biomedical waste.

One major effect of biomedical waste is on the environment. Throwing medical waste in open landfills allows it to mix with the soil, which adversely reduces the soil's fertility. Additionally, burning medical waste in open areas releases toxic gases and furans. Lastly, rainwater washes harmful chemicals, blood, and pathogens into lakes, wells, and rivers. This shows that biomedical waste is harmful to the environment.

Another big impact of bio-medical waste is on mankind first; burning of medical waste results in human diseases like lung diseases, eye irritation, cancer, or tuberculosis. Along with this, stray animals may eat the medical waste in open areas, which increases the chances of diseases spreading back to humans. Lastly, the water pollution caused by medical waste washed away into waterbodies makes the water dangerous for drinking and irrigation, which can cause diseases like typhoid or cholera. This shows that medical waste is very harmful to humans, too.

There are many solutions that can help reduce biomedical waste. To begin with, bio-medical waste must be treated before disposal through autoclaving, microwaving, or chemical treatment. These methods kill the germs in the waste. Moreover, proper incineration in waste treatment plants should be done. Expired medicines should be returned to pharmacies or authorised collection centres. Hospitals should be trained properly. If people follow these steps, the accumulation of biomedical waste will be reduced, which will lead to less pollution on Mother Earth.

The generation of bio-medical waste is caused due to improper management, but can be solved by efficient ways. In conclusion, this essay explains how biomedical waste harms mankind and the environment, and the possible solutions that can be applied. Throwing may kill an innocent animal.`,

    essay: `Did you know that electronic waste is destroying the environment? Electronic waste is also known as E-waste. E-waste includes electronic items such as old computers, mobiles, batteries, chargers, and cables that are no longer useful and are thrown away. According to a report, around 7 lakh tonnes of E-waste were generated in the year 2017-18, which showed a huge rise by 2021-22 and is expected to cross over 16 million tonnes by 2030. In this essay, I will discuss how electronic waste is a serious problem by exploring not only how it affects humans and harms the environment, but also the possible solutions to manage electronic waste.

One major effect of electronic waste is on the environment. To begin with, toxic metals like Lead, mercury, chromium, and lithium, and flame retardant chemicals from e-waste seep into the ground. This reduces its soil quality and fertility, which affects plant growth. Also, heavy metal contamination in water, like ponds, rivers, becomes unsafe for drinking, farming, and fish habitats. It also damages the entire ecosystem; furthermore, the food chain gets disturbed, and biodiversity decreases as habitats become unsafe. This shows that electronic waste is harmful to the environment.

Another big impact of electronic waste is on humans. When E-waste breaks down or is handled improperly, toxic metals leak into the air, soil, and water. These toxic chemicals enter the body and hamrs our health. For example, if these toxins enter our body, they can cause headache, dizziness. Further, they can damage our brains and nerve cells, cause kidney and liver problems, and also increase the risk of cancer. This shows that electronic waste is dangerous to human health.

There are many solutions that can help reduce electronic waste. One solution is reducing the usage of e-waste by not buying new gadgets unnecessarily. We should choose durable goods, high-quality electronics that last longer. Additionally, we can reuse our old devices and donate working computers, mobiles, and appliances to someone who needs them. Moreover, supporting the government rules can help us manage e-waste. We can follow e-waste management rules that encourage recycling. If people follow these steps, then access waste of e-waste can be avoided.

In the end, we should avoid purchasing electronic items. We should decrease the amount of electronic waste generated. In conclusion, this essay explains how e-waste harms the environment, hurts animals and humans, and possible solutions can be taken to reduce e-waste. We should decrease the use of electronic waste so that pollution and human health issues can decrease and our loss of valuable minerals can gradually stop.`,
